/**
 * Abstraction of a connection which we can start/stop and connect to via streams.
 * It's typically used to wrap startup of language servers and to retrieve their
 * streams. 
 * There most likely an existing Java class already taking care of this somewhere
 * in a popular API. In such case, we should consider getting read of this one and
 * use a more popular similar interface.
 * Note that in the context of Eclipse, the ILaunch might be such interface but I'm
 * not sure we want to bind to org.eclipse.debug from this Language Server bindings.
 * 
 * This method MUST implement meaningful {@link #hashCode()} and {@link #equals(Object)}
 * to prevent multiple connections to be initiated multiple times.
